# StarterForSeleniumAutomation

This project is a starting point for anyone who is looking to use [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) and C# for automated testing of a web application

## Getting Started

Prerequisites - Microsoft Visual Studios (I used 2013)

1. Clone to machine or download project zip file
2. Open VS, in the top dropdown menus go to File -> Open -> Project/Solution
3. Find the StarterForSeleniumAutomation.sln file, select it from file chooser and click open
4. After the project is open, type Ctrl+Shift+B (Build the solution)
5. Now run the 'ExampleTest.cs' test, found at ./StarterForSeleniumAutomation/Tests/ExampleTest, by opening the file and right clicking in the '[TestClass]' and selecting 'Run Tests'
